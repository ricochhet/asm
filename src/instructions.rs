// TODO: Possibly add some instructions to assist with debugging?
// These would sort of act like environment variables.
//
// I would probably want to add a distinct marker for these variables,
// Possibly using the #, @, &, or $ symbol, although I would want to determine
// use cases for the other symbols first.
//
// Debug variables would not change any instruction, but would print what the instruction is doing
// I would want to pretty-print the value in some way so it doesn't feel like a gigantic dump of print
// statements when running your program.
//
//
// TODO: Consider renaming instructions to fit a more concise convention, I don't know exactly how I want
// to do this just yet, but the amount of instructions is going to increase and get more "cluttered"
// whether to make instructions more verbose or less verbose may be instruction-dependant.
//
// Things like `add` and `addf` may get annoying if we add other types. We could possibly just do `addi` and `addf`
// Should instructions like cls* and dlc* be converted to a clear * and dealloc * type? I'm personally not a huge fan
// of having to specify an enum-like string such as "clear stack" or "dealloc hash" but it would be confusing to use
// integers to reference what we want to delete or clear as well.
//
// There's not really anything wrong with making more verbose instructions like "dealloc_hash" but I want to keep the "trend"
// of an assembly like language abbreviating everything, just because I think it looks cool and overly technical.
